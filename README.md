Using the default terminal window in Mac is boring and unproductive. One should have a personalized Terminal which includes but is not limited to:
- Background Color or Theme
- Customized Prompt

Instead of forking other repos or using a software, I would prefer to build something from scratch. I know many would consider this a waster of effort, but I would like to give it a shot!

Work in Progress!
