Using the default terminal window in Mac is boring and unproductive. One should have a personalized Terminal which includes but is not limited to:
- Background Color or Theme
- Customized Prompt

Instead of forking other repos or using a software, I would prefer to build something from scratch. I know many would consider this a waste of effort, but I would like to give it a shot!

My initial research took me to the following webpage:

[customizing-the-terminal/](https://www.davidculley.com/customizing-the-terminal/)

The author of this page uses the following tools:
- z-shell
- Oh-My-Zsh
- i-term2

I plan to write a shell script which would contain all the installation steps (WIP)
